# Sell command configuration.

# With this option you will toggle this feature
# This is the unique way to sell drops
# If you want to use another sell system
# The unique way is using our custom drop String NBT: 'bluegens-drop-price'
# And you need to parse it to Integer
#
# I recommend to have this option enabled because it can be compatible with others plugins (this depends on other developers)
enabled: true

# Action List:
#   '<actionbar> &aExample' - 'actionbar: &aExample' - '[actionbar] &aExample'
#   '<console> kill %player_name%' - 'console: say hello world!' - '[console] eco give %player_name% 1'
#   '<message> &aHello %player_name%' - 'message: &aHello %player_name%' - '[message] &aHello %player_name%'
#   '<titles> &aHello!<subtitle>&6%player_name%' - 'titles: &aHello!<subtitle>&6%player_name%' - '[titles] &aHello!<subtitle>&6%player_name%'

# These actions are executed when a player uses /sell command successfully.
# Extra variables are with PlaceholderAPI
# Internal variables: <player_name>, <player_displayname>, <total>, <total_formatted>
actions:
  - '<titles>&a&lSold!<subtitle>&eYou win <total_formatted>'

# You can add more items depending on what you want
# but if you want to blacklist specified heads or items with specified data
# The unique way is using our Dev API with our custom event: me.blueslime.bluegens.listeners.api.SellEvent
#
# If you want to add more items just use this format:
#   (ITEM ID DEPENDING ON YOUR VERSION): (PRICE IN DOUBLE)
# Example:
#   BEDROCK: 100.0
